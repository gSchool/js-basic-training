# JavaScript Basic Training

**This training module intends to bring you from zero knowledge about programming in JavaScript, to having a clear path forward for the skill level needed to be admitted into the Galvanize Web Development Immersive.**

By the time you complete this module you will be able to:

- Understand how JavaScript fits into modern web development
- Understand what a function is
- Use built in JavaScript functions
- Use built in JavaScript functions to return values
- Discuss the different kinds of JavaScript Data Types
- Assign values, including values returned from functions, into variables
- Use built in string methods
- Create arrays and use built in array methods
- Create your own functions that define parameters and return values
- Think about difficult programming challenges in terms of easy to think about functions

Additionally, this modules contains two advanced resources should you wish to level up above and beyond the technical level required for admissions which will set you up to be able to:
